        About me
      </p>
      <p class="par">
        My legal name is Raphael Wanders and am 19 years old. I have achieved a Software Development MBO 4 diploma within 2 years, and am currently looking for a job.
      </p>

        My best skills fit perfectly for that which I love doing most. 
        I am a fast learner; You could tell me about something new and within the hour I can hold a good conversation about that topic. 
        I look at things analytically; Show me a complex problem, and I will manage to break it down into segments that are easy to understand for everyone.
        I personalize communication; When someone does not understand something, I can manage to use words structured in ways that they will understand.
      </p>

        I’ve loved coding & programming since I was still very young. A whole world of creativity, achieve anything you wish to achieve. All with structure and order.
        Next to coding I also love to do art, with art I go far and wide to see what all is possible with different methods of creation. You might as well say that coding is part of my art.
      </p>
